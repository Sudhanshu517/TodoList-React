## 🧠 How It Works

- The app uses `useState` to manage local component state.
- Todos are stored as objects with `{ id, todo, isCompleted }`.
- On app load (`useEffect`), it fetches todos from `localStorage`.
- Any changes to the todos array are synced to `localStorage` for persistence.

## 📌 Upcoming Improvements

- Add due dates and categories
- Task filtering and search
- Dark mode toggle
- Backend integration for multi-device sync
